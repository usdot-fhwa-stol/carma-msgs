# j2735_msgs

This package contains ROS1 messages that are used for V2X communication in CARMA Platform and exactly match their associated ASN.1 specifications as defined in SAE J2735. If a message does not exactly match an ASN.1 specified message, it should be defined in carma_v2x_msgs instead of here.

**NOTE:** For all ROS2 development this package should be considered deprecated.
