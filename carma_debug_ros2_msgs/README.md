# carma_debug_msgs

This package is for message specs meant to support debugging in carma platform and should not be considered a stable message set.
The intended use case for these messages is not as interfaces between components see the other ROS2 packages for that.
If one of these messages seems useful as an interface it should be ported to cav_msgs so as to preserve the separation between both message sets.

This is the ROS 2 varient of this package see carma_debug_msgs for the ROS1 varient of this message set
