#
# The DF_AdvisorySpeed data frame is used to convey a recommended traveling approach speed to an intersection
# from the message issuer to various travelers and vehicle types. Besides support for various eco-driving applications, this
# allows transmitting recommended speeds for specialty vehicles such as transit buses.
# AdvisorySpeed ::= SEQUENCE {
# type AdvisorySpeedType,
# -- the type of advisory which this is.
# speed SpeedAdvice OPTIONAL,
# -- See Section 11 for converting and translating speed
# -- expressed in mph into units of m/s
# -- This element is optional ONLY when superceded
# -- by the presence of a regional speed element found in
# -- Reg-AdvisorySpeed entry
# confidence SpeedConfidence OPTIONAL,
# -- A confidence value for the above speed
# distance ZoneLength OPTIONAL,
# -- Unit = 1 meter,
# -- The distance indicates the region for which the advised speed
# -- is recommended, it is specified upstream from the stop bar
# -- along the connected egressing lane
# class RestrictionClassID OPTIONAL,
# -- the vehicle types to which it applies
# -- when absent, the AdvisorySpeed applies to
# -- all motor vehicle types
# regional SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..4)) OF RegionalExtension {{REGION.Reg-AdvisorySpeed}} OPTIONAL,
# ...
# }

j2735_msgs/AdvisorySpeedType type

# Deviates from J2735 standard:
# SpeedAdvice in this message are conveyed as m/s rather than 1/10th m/s to avoid redundant unnecessary conversion by subscribers
# SpeedAdvice ::= FLOAT (0..50.0) OPTIONAL
# This data element represents the recommended velocity of an object, typically a vehicle speed along a roadway.
#-- the value 49.9 shall be used for values at or greater than 49.9 m/s
#-- the value 50.0 shall be used to indicate that speed is unavailable
float32 speed
float32 SPEED_UNAVAILABLE = 50.0
bool speed_exists

# SpeedConfidence is an enum already with 0 as unavailable.

# ZoneLength ::= INTEGER (0..10000)

# -- The value 10000 to be used for Distances >=10000 m
# -- (e.g. from known point to another point along a
# -- known path, often against traffic flow direction
# -- when used for measuring queues)
