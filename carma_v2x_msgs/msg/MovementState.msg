# The MovementState data frame is used to convey various information about the current or future movement state of
# a designated collection of one or more lanes of a common type. This is referred to as the GroupID. Note that lane object
# types supported include both motorized vehicle lanes as well as pedestrian lanes and dedicated rail and transit lanes. Of
# the reported data elements, the time to change (the time remaining in the current state) is often of the most value. Lanes
# with a common state (typically adjacent sets of lanes in an approach) in a signalized intersection will have individual lane
# values such as total vehicle counts, summed. It is used in the SPAT message to convey every active movement in a
# given intersection so that vehicles, when combined with certain map information, can determine the state of the signal
# phases.

# state-time-speed MovementEventList,
# -- Consisting of sets of movement data with:
# -- a) SignalPhaseState
# -- b) TimeChangeDetails, and
# -- c) AdvisorySpeeds (optional )
# -- Note one or more of the movement events may be for
# -- a future time and that this allows conveying multiple
# -- predictive phase and movement timing for various uses
