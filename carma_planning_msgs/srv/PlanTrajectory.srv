# Stamp for the header should match time that vehicle state was computed. 
# This may be later than the maneuver_plan header and possibly in the future if multiple plan trajectory requests were sent for one maneuver plan

# The starting state of the vehicle
carma_planning_msgs/VehicleState vehicle_state

# The set of maneuvers to be executed
carma_planning_msgs/ManeuverPlan maneuver_plan

# The initial trajectory plan to be modified

# The returned trajectory
carma_planning_msgs/TrajectoryPlan trajectory_plan

# A set of array indexes which map to the maneuvers in the provided maneuver_plan
# These indicate which maneuvers the returned trajectory is addressing
uint8[] related_maneuvers

# A list of maneuver completion status which map 1-1 with the related_maneuvers array
# Later maneuvers in this list should never be marked in complete unless the preceding maneuver is marked complete
uint8[] maneuver_status

# Enum of maneuver statuses
