# carma_debug_msgs

This package is for message specs meant to support debugging in carma platform and should not be considered a stable message set.
The intended use case for these messages is not as interfaces between components see the cav_msgs package for that.
If one of these messages seems useful as an interface it should be ported to cav_msgs so as to preserve the separation between both message sets.

This is the ROS 1 variant of this package see carma_debug_ros2_msgs for the ROS2 varient of this message set
