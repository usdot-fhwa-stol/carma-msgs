# j3224_v2x_msgs

This package contains ROS2 messages that are used for V2X communication in CARMA Platform and exactly match their associated ASN.1 specifications as defined in SAE J3224. If a message does not exactly match an ASN.1 specified message, it should be defined in carma_v2x_msgs instead of here.
